## 1. Vision & Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Vision

Build a **configurable AI company framework** where AI agents operate within a virtual organization. Each agent has a defined role, personality, skills, memory, and model backend. The company can be configured from a 2-person startup to a 50+ enterprise, handling software development, business operations, creative work, or any domain.

### 1.2 Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Configuration over Code** | Company structures, roles, and workflows defined via config, not hardcoded |
| **Provider Agnostic** | Any LLM backend: Claude API, OpenRouter, Ollama, custom endpoints |
| **Composable** | Mix and match roles, teams, workflows. Build any type of company |
| **Observable** | Every agent action, communication, and decision is logged and visible |
| **Autonomy Spectrum** | From full human oversight to fully autonomous operation |
| **Cost Aware** | Built-in budget tracking, model routing optimization, spending controls |
| **Extensible** | Plugin architecture for new roles, tools, providers, and workflows |
| **Local First** | Runs locally with option to expose on network or host remotely later |

### 1.3 What This Is NOT

- Not a chatbot or conversational AI product
- Not locked to software development only (though that is a primary use case)
- Not a wrapper around a single model or provider
- Not a toy/demo - designed for real, production-quality output

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Agent** | An AI entity with a role, personality, model backend, memory, and tool access. The primary entity in the framework. Within a company context, agents serve as the company's employees. |
| **Company** | A configured organization of agents with structure, hierarchy, and workflows |
| **Department** | A grouping of related roles (Engineering, Product, Design, Operations, etc.) |
| **Role** | A job definition with required skills, responsibilities, authority level, and tool access |
| **Skill** | A capability an agent possesses (coding, writing, analysis, design, etc.) |
| **Task** | A unit of work assigned to one or more agents |
| **Project** | A collection of related tasks with a goal, deadline, and assigned team |
| **Meeting** | A structured multi-agent interaction for decisions, reviews, or planning |
| **Artifact** | Any output produced by agents: code, documents, designs, reports, etc. |

```

### 4.3 Department Configuration

```yaml
departments:
  engineering:
    head: "cto"
    budget_percent: 60
    teams:
      - name: "backend"
        lead: "backend_lead"
        members: ["sr_backend_1", "mid_backend_1", "jr_backend_1"]
      - name: "frontend"
        lead: "frontend_lead"
        members: ["sr_frontend_1", "mid_frontend_1"]
  product:
    head: "cpo"
    budget_percent: 20
    teams:
      - name: "core"
        lead: "pm_lead"
        members: ["pm_1", "ux_designer_1", "ui_designer_1"]
  operations:
    head: "coo"
    budget_percent: 10
    teams:
      - name: "devops"
        lead: "devops_lead"
        members: ["sre_1"]
  quality:
    head: "qa_lead"
    budget_percent: 10
    teams:
      - name: "qa"
        lead: "qa_lead"
        members: ["qa_engineer_1", "automation_engineer_1"]
```

### 4.4 Dynamic Scaling

The company can dynamically grow or shrink:

- **Auto-scale**: HR agent detects workload increase, proposes new hires
- **Manual scale**: Human adds/removes agents via config or UI
- **Budget-driven**: CFO agent caps headcount based on budget constraints
- **Skill-gap**: HR analyzes team capabilities, identifies missing skills, proposes hires

## 5. Communication Architecture

### 5.1 Communication Patterns

The system supports multiple communication patterns, configurable per company:

#### Pattern 1: Event-Driven Message Bus (Recommended Default)

```
┌──────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│  Agent A  │────▶│   Message Bus    │◀────│  Agent B  │
└──────────┘     │  (Topics/Queues) │     └──────────┘
                 └────────┬────────┘
                          │
              ┌───────────┼───────────┐
              ▼           ▼           ▼
        #engineering  #product   #all-hands
        #code-review  #design    #incidents
```

- Agents publish to topics, subscribe to relevant channels
- Async by default, enables parallelism
- Decoupled - agents don't need to know about each other
- Natural audit trail of all communications
- **Best for**: Most scenarios, scales well, production-ready pattern

#### Pattern 2: Hierarchical Delegation

```
CEO ──▶ CTO ──▶ Eng Lead ──▶ Sr Dev ──▶ Jr Dev
                    │
                    └──▶ QA Lead ──▶ QA Eng
```

- Tasks flow down the hierarchy, results flow up
- Each level can decompose/refine tasks before delegating
- Authority enforcement built into the flow
- **Best for**: Structured organizations, clear chains of command

#### Pattern 3: Meeting-Based

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│        Sprint Planning          │
│  PM + CTO + Devs + QA + Design │
│  Output: Sprint backlog         │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
         │
┌────────┴────────┐
│  Daily Standup  │
│  Devs + QA      │
│  Output: Status │
└─────────────────┘
```

- Structured multi-agent conversations at defined intervals
- Standup, sprint planning, retrospective, design review, code review
- **Best for**: Agile workflows, decision-making, alignment

#### Pattern 4: Hybrid (Recommended for Full Company)

Combines all three:
- **Message bus** for async daily work and notifications
- **Hierarchical delegation** for task assignment and approvals
- **Meetings** for cross-team decisions and planning ceremonies

### 5.2 Communication Standards

The framework should align with emerging industry standards:

- **A2A Protocol** (Agent-to-Agent, Linux Foundation) - For inter-agent task delegation, capability discovery via Agent Cards, and structured task lifecycle management
- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol, Agentic AI Foundation / Linux Foundation) - For agent-to-tool integration, providing standardized tool discovery and invocation

### 5.3 Message Format

```json
{
  "id": "msg-uuid",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-27T10:30:00Z",
  "from": "sarah_chen",
  "to": "engineering",
  "type": "task_update",
  "priority": "normal",
  "channel": "#backend",
  "content": "Completed API endpoint for user authentication. PR ready for review.",
  "attachments": [
    {"type": "artifact", "ref": "pr-42"}
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "task_id": "task-123",
    "project_id": "proj-456",
    "tokens_used": 1200,
    "cost_usd": 0.018
  }
}
```

### 5.4 Communication Config

```yaml
communication:
  default_pattern: "hybrid"
  message_bus:
    backend: "internal"        # internal, redis, rabbitmq, kafka
    channels:
      - "#all-hands"
      - "#engineering"
      - "#product"
      - "#design"
      - "#incidents"
      - "#code-review"
      - "#watercooler"
  meetings:
    enabled: true
    types:
      - name: "daily_standup"
        frequency: "per_sprint_day"
        participants: ["engineering", "qa"]
        duration_tokens: 2000
      - name: "sprint_planning"
        frequency: "bi_weekly"
        participants: ["all"]
        duration_tokens: 5000
      - name: "code_review"
        trigger: "on_pr"
        participants: ["author", "reviewers"]
  hierarchy:
    enforce_chain_of_command: true
    allow_skip_level: false    # can a junior message the CEO directly?
```

### 5.5 Loop Prevention

Agent communication loops (A delegates to B who delegates back to A) are a critical risk. The framework enforces multiple safeguards:

| Mechanism | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Max delegation depth** | Hard limit on chain length (A→B→C→D stops at depth N) | 5 |
| **Message rate limit** | Max messages per agent pair within a time window | 10 per minute |
| **Identical request dedup** | Detects and rejects duplicate task delegations within a window | 60s window |
| **Circuit breaker** | If an agent pair exceeds error/bounce threshold, block further messages until manual reset or cooldown | 3 bounces → 5min cooldown |
| **Task ancestry tracking** | Every delegated task carries its full delegation chain; agents cannot delegate back to any ancestor in the chain | Always on |

```yaml
loop_prevention:
  max_delegation_depth: 5
  rate_limit:
    max_per_pair_per_minute: 10
    burst_allowance: 3
  dedup_window_seconds: 60
  circuit_breaker:
    bounce_threshold: 3
    cooldown_seconds: 300
  ancestry_tracking: true       # always on, not configurable
```

When a loop is detected, the framework:
1. Blocks the looping message
2. Notifies the sending agent with the detected loop chain
3. Escalates to the sender's manager (or human if at top of hierarchy)
4. Logs the loop for analytics and process improvement

## 7. Memory & Persistence

### 7.1 Memory Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Agent Memory System             │
├──────────┬──────────┬───────────┬───────────┤
│ Working  │ Episodic │ Semantic  │Procedural │
│ Memory   │ Memory   │ Memory    │ Memory    │
│          │          │           │           │

│   SQLite / PostgreSQL / File-based / Mem0    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 7.2 Memory Types

| Type | Scope | Persistence | Example |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Working** | Current task | None (in-context) | "I'm implementing the auth endpoint" |
| **Episodic** | Past events | Configurable | "Last sprint we chose JWT over sessions" |
| **Semantic** | Knowledge | Long-term | "This project uses FastAPI with SQLAlchemy" |
| **Procedural** | Skills/patterns | Long-term | "Code reviews require 2 approvals here" |
| **Social** | Relationships | Long-term | "The QA lead prefers detailed test plans" |

### 7.3 Memory Levels (Configurable)

```yaml
memory:
  level: "full"                 # none, session, project, full
  backend: "sqlite"             # sqlite, postgresql, mem0, file
  options:
    retention_days: null         # null = forever
    max_memories_per_agent: 10000
    consolidation_interval: "daily"  # compress old memories
    shared_knowledge_base: true      # agents can access shared facts
```

---

## 8. HR & Workforce Management

### 8.1 Hiring Process

The HR system manages the agent workforce dynamically:

1. HR agent (or human) identifies skill gap or workload issue
2. HR generates **candidate cards** based on team needs:
   - What skills are underrepresented?
   - What seniority level is needed?
   - What personality would complement the team?
   - What model/provider fits the budget?
3. Candidate cards are presented for approval (to CEO or human)
4. Approved candidates are instantiated and onboarded
5. Onboarding includes: company context, project briefing, team introductions.

### 8.2 Firing / Offboarding

1. Triggered by: budget cuts, poor performance metrics, project completion, human decision
2. Agent's memory is archived (not deleted)
3. Active tasks are reassigned
4. Team is notified

### 8.3 Performance Tracking

```yaml
agent_metrics:
  tasks_completed: 42
  tasks_failed: 2
  average_quality_score: 8.5     # from code reviews, peer feedback
  average_cost_per_task: 0.45
  average_completion_time: "2h"
  collaboration_score: 7.8       # peer ratings
  last_review_date: "2026-02-20"
```

### 8.4 Promotions & Demotions

Agents can move between seniority levels based on performance:
- Promotion criteria: sustained high quality scores, task complexity handled, peer feedback
- Demotion criteria: repeated failures, quality drops, cost inefficiency
- Promotions can unlock higher tool access levels (see Progressive Trust)
- Model upgrades/downgrades may accompany level changes (configurable)

```

### 9.2 Provider Configuration

> Note: Model IDs, pricing, and provider examples below are **illustrative**. Actual models, costs, and provider availability will be determined during implementation and should be loaded dynamically from provider APIs where possible.

```yaml
providers:
  anthropic:
    api_key: "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
    models:                        # example entries — real list loaded from provider
      - id: "claude-opus-4-6"
        alias: "opus"
        cost_per_1k_input: 0.015   # illustrative, verify at implementation time
        cost_per_1k_output: 0.075
        max_context: 200000
      - id: "claude-sonnet-4-6"
        alias: "sonnet"
        cost_per_1k_input: 0.003
        cost_per_1k_output: 0.015
        max_context: 200000
      - id: "claude-haiku-4-5"
        alias: "haiku"
        cost_per_1k_input: 0.0008
        cost_per_1k_output: 0.004
        max_context: 200000

  openrouter:
    api_key: "${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}"
    base_url: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
    models:                        # example entries
      - id: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"
        alias: "or-sonnet"
      - id: "google/gemini-2.5-pro"
        alias: "or-gemini-pro"
      - id: "deepseek/deepseek-r1"
        alias: "or-deepseek"

  ollama:
    base_url: "http://localhost:11434"
    models:                        # example entries
      - id: "llama3.3:70b"
        alias: "local-llama"
        cost_per_1k_input: 0.0    # free, local
        cost_per_1k_output: 0.0
      - id: "qwen2.5-coder:32b"
        alias: "local-coder"
        cost_per_1k_input: 0.0
        cost_per_1k_output: 0.0
```

### 9.3 LiteLLM Integration (Candidate)

Use **LiteLLM** as the provider abstraction layer:
- Unified API across 100+ providers
- Built-in cost tracking
- Automatic retries and fallbacks
- Load balancing across providers
- OpenAI-compatible interface (all providers normalized)

### 9.4 Model Routing Strategy

```yaml
routing:
  strategy: "smart"              # smart, cheapest, fastest, manual
  rules:
    - role_level: "c_suite"
      preferred_model: "opus"
      fallback: "sonnet"
    - role_level: "senior"
      preferred_model: "sonnet"
      fallback: "haiku"

## 10. Cost & Budget Management

### 10.1 Budget Hierarchy

```text
Company Budget ($100/month)
  ├── Engineering Dept (50%) ── $50
  │     ├── Backend Team (40%) ── $20
  │     ├── Frontend Team (30%) ── $15
  │     └── DevOps Team (30%) ── $15
  ├── Quality/QA (10%) ── $10
  ├── Product Dept (15%) ── $15
  ├── Operations (10%) ── $10
  └── Reserve (15%) ── $15
```

> Note: Percentages are illustrative defaults. All allocations are configurable per company.

### 10.2 Cost Tracking

Every API call is tracked (illustrative schema):

```json
{
  "agent_id": "sarah_chen",
  "task_id": "task-123",
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
  "input_tokens": 4500,
  "output_tokens": 1200,
  "cost_usd": 0.0315,
  "timestamp": "2026-02-27T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### 10.3 CFO Agent Responsibilities

The CFO agent (when enabled) acts as a cost management system:

- Monitors real-time spending across all agents
- Alerts when departments approach budget limits
- Suggests model downgrades when budget is tight
- Reports daily/weekly spending summaries
- Recommends hiring/firing based on cost efficiency
- Blocks tasks that would exceed remaining budget
- Optimizes model routing for cost/quality balance

### 10.4 Cost Controls

```yaml
budget:
  total_monthly: 100.00
  alerts:
    warn_at: 75               # percent
    critical_at: 90
    hard_stop_at: 100
  per_task_limit: 5.00
  per_agent_daily_limit: 10.00
  auto_downgrade:
    enabled: true
    threshold: 85              # percent of budget used
    downgrade_map:             # example — aliases reference configured models
      opus: "sonnet"
      sonnet: "haiku"
      haiku: "local-small"
```

      auto_approve: []
      human_approval: ["all"]
      security_agent: true        # still runs for audit logging, but human is approval authority
```

### 12.3 Security Operations Agent

A special meta-agent that reviews all actions before execution:

- Evaluates safety of proposed actions
- Checks for data leaks, credential exposure, destructive operations
- Validates actions against company policies
- Maintains an audit log of all approvals/denials
- Escalates uncertain cases to human queue with explanation
- **Cannot be overridden by other agents** (only human can override)

### 15.2 Technology Stack (Candidates - TBD After Research)

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Language** | Python 3.12+ | Best AI/ML ecosystem, all major frameworks use it, LiteLLM/Mem0/MCP all Python-native. Claude Code writes Python well. |
| **API Framework** | FastAPI | Async-native, WebSocket support, auto OpenAPI docs, high performance, type-safe with Pydantic |
| **LLM Abstraction** | LiteLLM | 100+ providers, unified API, built-in cost tracking, retries/fallbacks |
| **Agent Memory** | Mem0 + SQLite | Mem0 for semantic/episodic memory, SQLite for structured data. Upgrade to Postgres later |
| **Message Bus** | Internal (async queues) → Redis | Start with Python asyncio queues, upgrade to Redis for multi-process/distributed |
| **Task Queue** | Internal → Celery/Redis | Start simple, scale with Celery when needed |
| **Database** | SQLite → PostgreSQL | Start lightweight, migrate to Postgres for production/multi-user |
| **Web UI** | React or Vue 3 + Vite | Modern, fast, good ecosystem. Vue slightly simpler for dashboards |
| **Real-time** | WebSocket (FastAPI native) | Real-time agent activity, task updates, chat feed |
| **Containerization** | Docker + Docker Compose | Isolated code execution, reproducible environments |
| **Tool Integration** | MCP (Model Context Protocol) | Industry standard for LLM-to-tool integration |
| **Agent Comms** | A2A Protocol compatible | Future-proof inter-agent communication |
| **Config Format** | YAML + Pydantic validation | Human-readable config with strict validation |
| **CLI** | Typer (Click-based) | Pythonic CLI framework, auto-help, completions |

### 15.4 Key Design Decisions (Preliminary - Subject to Research)

| Decision | Choice | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|----------|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| Language | Python | TypeScript, Go, Rust | AI ecosystem, LiteLLM/Mem0 are Python, Claude Code writes Python well |
| API | FastAPI | Flask, Django, aiohttp | Async native, Pydantic integration, auto docs, WebSocket support |
| LLM Layer | LiteLLM | Direct APIs, OpenRouter only | 100+ providers, cost tracking, fallbacks, load balancing built-in |
| Memory | Mem0 + SQLite | Custom, ChromaDB, Pinecone | Production-proven (26% accuracy boost), supports all memory types, open-source |
| Message Bus | asyncio queues → Redis | Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS | Start simple, Redis well-supported, Kafka overkill for local |
| Config | YAML + Pydantic | JSON, TOML, Python dicts | Human-friendly, strict validation, good IDE support |
| CLI | Typer | Click, argparse, Fire | Built on Click, auto-completion, type hints |
| Web UI | Vue 3 | React, Svelte, HTMX | Simpler than React for dashboards, good with FastAPI |

## 16. Research & Prior Art

### 16.1 Existing Frameworks Comparison

| Framework | Stars | Architecture | Roles | Models | Memory | Custom Roles | Production Ready |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-------|--------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **MetaGPT** | 64.5k | SOP-driven pipeline | PM, Architect, Engineer, QA | OpenAI, Ollama, Groq, Azure | Limited | Partial | Research → MGX commercial |
| **ChatDev 2.0** | 31.2k | Zero-code visual workflows | CEO, CTO, Programmer, Tester, Designer | Multiple via config | Limited | Yes (YAML) | Improving (v2.0 Jan 2026) |
| **CrewAI** | ~50k+ | Role-based crews + flows | Fully custom | Multi-provider | Basic (crew memory) | Yes | Yes (100k+ developers) |
| **AutoGen** | ~40k+ | Conversation-driven async | Custom agents | OpenAI primary, others | Session-based | Yes | Transitioning to MS Agent Framework |
| **LangGraph** | Large | Graph-based DAG | Custom nodes | LangChain ecosystem | Stateful graphs | Yes (nodes) | Yes |
| **Smolagents** | Growing | Code-centric minimal | Code agent | HuggingFace ecosystem | Minimal | Yes | Rapid prototyping |

### 16.2 What Exists vs What We Need

| Feature | MetaGPT | ChatDev | CrewAI | **AI Company (Ours)** |
|---------|---------|---------|--------|----------------------|
| Full company simulation | Partial | Partial | No | **Yes - complete** |
| HR (hiring/firing) | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Budget management (CFO) | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Persistent agent memory | No | No | Basic | **Yes (Mem0 candidate)** |
| Agent personalities | Basic | Basic | Basic | **Deep - traits, styles, evolution** |
| Dynamic team scaling | No | No | Manual | **Yes - auto + manual** |
| Multiple company types | No | No | Manual | **Yes - templates + builder** |
| Security ops agent | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Configurable autonomy | No | No | Limited | **Yes - full spectrum** |
| Local + cloud providers | Partial | Partial | Partial | **Yes - unified abstraction (LiteLLM candidate)** |
| Cost tracking per agent | No | No | No | **Yes - full budget system** |
| Progressive trust | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Performance metrics | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| MCP tool integration | No | No | Partial | **Yes** |
| A2A protocol support | No | No | No | **Planned** |
| Community marketplace | MGX (commercial) | No | No | **Planned (backlog)** |

### 16.3 Build vs Fork Decision

**Recommendation: Build from scratch, leverage libraries.**

Rationale:
- No existing framework covers even 50% of our requirements
- Our core differentiators (HR, budget, security ops, deep personalities, progressive trust) don't exist in any framework
- Forking MetaGPT or CrewAI would mean fighting their architecture while adding our features
- **LiteLLM**, **Mem0**, **FastAPI**, and **MCP** give us battle-tested components for the hard parts
- The "company simulation" layer on top is our unique value and must be purpose-built

What we **plan to leverage** (not fork) — subject to evaluation:
- **LiteLLM** (candidate) - Provider abstraction
- **Mem0** (candidate) - Agent memory
- **FastAPI** (candidate) - API layer
- **MCP** - Tool integration standard (strong candidate, emerging industry standard)
- **Pydantic** (candidate) - Config validation and data models
- **Typer** (candidate) - CLI
- **Web UI framework** - TBD (Vue 3, React, Svelte, HTMX all under consideration)

## 17. Open Questions & Risks

### 17.1 Open Questions

| # | Question | Impact | Notes |
|---|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | How deep should agent personality affect output? | Medium | Too deep = inconsistent, too shallow = all agents feel the same |
| 2 | What is the optimal meeting format for multi-agent? | High | Determines quality of collaborative decisions |
| 3 | How to handle context window limits for long tasks? | High | Agents may lose track of complex multi-file changes |
| 4 | Should agents be able to create/modify other agents? | Medium | CTO "hires" a dev by creating a new agent config |
| 5 | How to handle conflicting agent opinions? | High | Two agents disagree on architecture - who wins? |
| 6 | What metrics define "good" agent performance? | Medium | Needed for HR/hiring/firing decisions |
| 7 | How to prevent agent communication loops? | High | Agent A asks Agent B who asks Agent A... |
| 8 | Optimal message bus for local-first architecture? | Medium | asyncio queues vs Redis vs embedded broker |
| 9 | How to handle code execution safely? | High | Sandboxing strategy, Docker vs WASM vs subprocess |
| 10 | What's the minimum viable meeting set? | Low | Standup + planning + review as minimum? |

### 17.2 Technical Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Context window exhaustion on complex tasks | High | Memory summarization, task decomposition, working memory management |
| Cost explosion from agent loops | High | Budget hard stops, loop detection, max iterations per task |
| Agent quality degradation with cheap models | Medium | Quality gates, minimum model requirements per task type |
| Third-party library breaking changes | Medium | Pin versions, integration tests, abstraction layers |
| Memory retrieval quality | Medium | Evaluate candidates (Mem0, custom, etc.) against our use case |
| Agent personality inconsistency | Low | Strong system prompts, few-shot examples, personality tests |
| WebSocket scaling | Low | Start local, add Redis pub/sub when needed |

### 17.3 Architecture Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Over-engineering the MVP | High | Start with minimal viable company (3-5 agents), add complexity iteratively |
| Config format becoming unwieldy | Medium | Good defaults, layered config (base + overrides), validation |
| Agent execution bottlenecks | Medium | Async execution, parallel agent processing, queue-based |
| Data loss on crash | Medium | WAL mode SQLite, periodic snapshots, recovery system |

| Benchmarking suite | Medium | Compare company configurations on standard tasks |
| Visual workflow editor | Medium | Drag-and-drop workflow design in Web UI |
| Multi-project support | High | Company handles multiple projects simultaneously |
| Client simulation | Low | AI "clients" that give requirements and review output |
| Training mode | Medium | New agents learn from senior agents' past work |
| Conflict resolution protocol | High | Structured process when agents disagree |
| Agent promotions | Medium | Junior → Mid → Senior based on performance |
| Shift system | Low | Agents "work" in shifts, different agents for different hours |
| Reporting system | Medium | Weekly/monthly automated company reports |
| Integration APIs | Medium | Connect to real Slack, GitHub, Jira, Linear |
| Self-improving company | High | The AI company developing AI company (meta!) |

### 18.2 Scaling Path

```
Phase 1: Local Single-Process
  └── Async runtime, embedded DB, in-memory bus, 1-10 agents

Phase 2: Local Multi-Process
  └── External message bus, production DB, sandboxed execution, 10-30 agents

Phase 3: Network/Server
  └── Full API, multi-user, distributed agents, 30-100 agents

Phase 4: Cloud/Hosted
  └── Container orchestration, horizontal scaling, marketplace, 100+ agents
```
